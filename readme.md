Java Domino Game Engine

A modular Java implementation of the back-end logic for three popular variants of the Domino game: Block, Draw, and Multiples (also known as All Fives or Muggins).
This project focuses on providing a robust and well-structured game engine that can be easily integrated with various user interfaces.
Features

    Multiple Game Variants: Supports three classic domino rulesets:

        Block Domino: The standard game where players cannot draw from the boneyard.

        Draw Domino: Players can draw tiles from the boneyard if they cannot play.

        Multiples Domino (All Fives/Muggins): A scoring game where players score points by making the open ends of the layout add up to a multiple of five.

    Clean Architecture: Separation of concerns through interfaces and dedicated data classes.

    Extensible Design: Easy to add new domino game variants by implementing the core interface.

    Well-Documented Code: Clear comments and logical structure for maintainability.
